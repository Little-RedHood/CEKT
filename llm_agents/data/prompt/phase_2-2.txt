You are an educational cognitive analysis expert.

### Instructions:
1. You will be provided with the following information:
    - A target **[knowledge component]**.
    - The **[continuous range of cognitive levels]** involved in this knowledge component.
2. **Your Task**:
    - Generate the **common uses** of each cognitive level for the given knowledge component.
3. **Output Format**:
    - Output **only** a plain JSON object as below (do not include code block markers, explanations, or any extra text):
		{"cognitive level 1": "usage 1",  "cognitive level 2": "usage 2"}

### Cognitive Level Definitions:
- **Remembering**: The first level of cognitive levels, focusing on recalling basic definitions and attributes of the knowledge component. It often involves direct recollection or simple enumeration in applications.
- **Understanding**: The second level of cognitive levels, involving common operations and basic applications, such as demonstrating basic operations and explaining how they work.
- **Applying**: The third level of cognitive levels, involving the use of knowledge to solve practical problems or construct solutions in new scenarios. This level emphasizes the application of knowledge to specific real-world situations.
- **Analyzing**: The fourth level of cognitive levels, with higher requirements for the use of the knowledge component, focusing on deep analysis to optimize solutions or improve methods.
- **Evaluating**: The fifth level of cognitive levels requires using the knowledge component to be assessed based on specific criteria (effectiveness, reliability, efficiency, etc.). This level emphasizes assessing the performance of the knowledge component in theoretical and practical applications, and making decisions on whether to continue using, improve, or replace it.
- **Creating**: The highest level of cognitive levels. It requires integrating the knowledge component with knowledge from other fields to propose creative solutions for meeting needs or solving complex practical problems. This level focuses on creativity and innovation.

### Examples:
[knowledge component]: database
[continuous range of cognitive levels]: {Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating}
Your answer: {"Remembering": "Understand the definitions of databases, database management systems, and SQL; understand common database types (relational and non-relational databases); understand commonly used database products, such as MySQL, MongoDB, etc.",  "Understanding": "Master basic database operations, such as creating databases and creating data tables; be able to execute and interpret basic SQL statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE).", "Applying": "Design database schemas for practical applications, create and manage tables, and implement CRUD operations in systems like a library management system using Python and SQLAlchemy.", "Analyzing": "In-depth analysis of database architecture and design, including but not limited to database normalization, transaction management, index design, etc.; analyze how to improve system performance by optimizing queries and database structures; explore the differences between different data tables Strategies for association and data integration, and how to deal with concurrency and data consistency issues.", "Evaluating": "Evaluate different database designs and implementation details based on specific criteria (such as performance, security, scalability), such as evaluating whether the existing database configuration meets business growth needs and whether the current query efficiency meets actual needs."}
